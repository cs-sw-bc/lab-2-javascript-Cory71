# Lab 2 JavaScript - Reflection Questions

## 🧠 Post-Lab Reflection

---

### **1. What project did you choose and why?**

**Interactive Web Form** - Event Registration Form with individual meal preferences.

**Why:** Provides real-world applicability, complex validation scenarios, and dynamic form behavior that demonstrates both individual field validation and overall state management.

---

### **2. Which Copilot suggestions were easiest to understand?**

- Basic HTML structure and semantic markup
- CSS styling with clear property-value pairs  
- Simple addEventListener patterns
- Basic if/else validation logic

These were easy because they followed standard patterns with clear variable names and logical progression.

---

### **3. Which part of the application logic was hardest, and how did Copilot help?**

**Hardest:** Dynamic meal preferences with real-time pricing for multiple guests.

**Challenges:** Managing state across dynamically generated elements, coordinating validation, handling form reset.

**How Copilot helped:** Provided DOM manipulation patterns, event delegation strategies, and comprehensive state management solutions.

---

### **4. What did you learn about breaking a problem into steps?**

**Key insights:**
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- One feature at a time with frequent testing
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concerns
- Each step validates before moving forward

This approach made debugging easier and code more maintainable.

---

### **5. When should you avoid relying on Copilot?**

- **Learning fundamentals** - Core programming concepts need human understanding
- **Security/business logic** - Critical code requires human oversight
- **Performance optimization** - Need deep technical knowledge
- **Architecture decisions** - High-level design should be human-driven
- **Complex debugging** - Learning to trace code logic independently

**Best practice:** Use as coding assistant, not replacement for understanding.
